# triple-triad
Triple triad for the browser

This is a browser-based mockup of the popular game Triple Triad, from the Final Fantasy franchise. It uses jQuery's draggable and droppable features, as well as grid snapping to achieve a quick and easy gameboard feel. The 11 cards in the deck are based off of the level 1 cards from Final Fantasy VIII. More cards will be added in the future.

The script takes advantage of jQuery and jQuery UI, as well as jQuery Flip by Nattawatt Nonsung (https://nnattawat.github.io/flip/). Background image is courtesy of subtlepatterns.com.
