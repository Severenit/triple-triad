# Triple Triad

This is a browser-based mockup of the popular game Triple Triad, from the Final Fantasy video game series. It uses jQuery's draggable and droppable features, as well as grid snapping to achieve a quick and easy gameboard feel. The 11 cards in the deck are based off of the level 1 cards from Final Fantasy VIII. More cards will be added in the future.
